# PythonScripts
This is the place where you can find python scripts that run independently of the ArcGIS toolbox.

1. AuroraProcessing is a collection of scripts that stores and processes the Auroras using the OVATION model from NOAA.
2. DrawArcPolygons.py draws circle arcs around point data if there is an orientation field
3. GetPlaceLatLong.py extracts point data based on a location search
