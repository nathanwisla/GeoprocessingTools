# AuroraProcessing
This collection of scripts uploads Aurora forecasts as timestamped point data to a postgres database.

With this point data saved, you can do additional geoprocessing in ArcGIS Pro to interpolate or even rasterize the point data.
Use the .ipynb to rasterize your point data into a spline dataset!
